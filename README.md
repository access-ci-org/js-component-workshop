# Building Modern User Interfaces with JavaScript Components

**Presented By:** Matt Yoder and Rebecca Eveland, ACCESS Allocations  
**Date and Time:** Wednesday, September 25, 2024, 10:00 - 12:00 Eastern  
**Location:** Hybrid event: in-person at ACCESS Quarterly Meeting and on Zoom

Component-based JavaScript frameworks like React and Preact allow developers to quickly and flexibly build complex, interactive web interfaces that can be deployed anywhere. In this workshop, participants will learn the fundamentals of developing JavaScript user interface components. They will complete a series of hands-on exercises designed to introduce concepts such as the render loop, JSX, and hooks. The goal is to build the skills necessary to contribute to ACCESS web interfaces, including the current resource catalog collaboration. Basic familiarity with JavaScript syntax is helpful, but developers with any level of programming experience are welcome.
